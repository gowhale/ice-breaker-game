# ice-breaker-game

## Introduction

The function of the code in this repository is to help facilitate an ice breaker game. Ice breakers are a great way to get people talking to each other in meetings especially virtual ones. As I am currently a student mentor for 9 first year Computer Science students, I will use this ice breaker to start the meeting and then go through the code with them. I’m sure they will have some great ideas about how I can improve the game further and some questions which I haven’t thought of yet. 

## Aim of the game:

In this ice breaker the team will be given a random letter and a list of topics. The host should then start a timer and the team must go through the list of topics and try to think of an abstract answer for each of the topics beginning with the random letter generated. 

For instance, if the letter “G” was selected and the topic was animals there you could answer with “Goat”, “Giraffe” etc.

Once the timer has gone off, the team should go through their answers. If you have a unique answer you will 10 points. If you get the same answer as someone else, you get 5 points. If you get a wrong answer or don’t answer you get 0 points.


## How to play?
1.	Execute the program, you will be given a random letter 
2.	Enter the number of topics you want to go through 
3.	A list of topics will be generated 
4.	Start a timer for x seconds
5.  Team will start to think of answers
5.	When the timer finishes go through the answers with the team 
6.	Tally up scores
7.	Repeat
